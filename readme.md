4. Virtual keyboard should support several languages (Russian and English will be enough) and we
should have a possibility to change our keyboard layout. That means when we press Ctrl + Shift /
Shift + Alt / Win + Space it should switch from one language to another.
5. Create an additional ToDo module where you will display a list of all todo elements and will have a
possibility to add a new todo element with some circumstances:

b. After the Enter key is pressed add a todo element to the list of all your todoes.
c. Have a possibility to focus or active any todo element from a list by arrow keys: t, |, â€”, >
(Home, End, Page Up, Page Down are optional).
